# Text copy extension

Was making a easy to copy text extension until I found : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/permanent-clipboard/hilkjcfodmbdgpadbpehimibheopoccb?hl=en

Nevertheless this repo can be cloned to form a foundation for other extensions.

## Features of this app

1. Have a list structure in which items can be added. 
2. Each li element has delete functionlity implemented.
3. Uses chrome local storage to save and retrive data. 
4. The alert text button is implemented to get the text inserted in a li.


Use this app as base for bigger projects.
